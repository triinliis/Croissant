    <h1>🥐 Croissants</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough. The dough
      is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in
      a process called lamination. The final dough is cut into triangles and
      rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a
      layered, flaky textured roll, more like puff pastry.
